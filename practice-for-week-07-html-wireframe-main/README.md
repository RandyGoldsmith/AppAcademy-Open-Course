# Exercise: HTML Wireframe

Wireframes are quick, lightweight outlines design specs that layout a web page.
Being able to discuss and plan your core elements allows your web page to have
a solid foundation to build on. This is an important skill when you work on
web design and development.

In this exercise, you will be identifying and discussing semantic HTML syntax
from an example wireframe.

Identify what HTML elements you think each part in the wireframe should be.

Which parts in the wireframe should the following HTML tags be assigned to?

- Main Heading (h1)
- Subheading (h2)
- Main Image (img)
- Text paragraphs (p)
- Links (underlined blue text) (a)
- Lists (ul, ol, li)
- Sections (div)
- Social media icons (identify what tag a social media icon is)

Are there any other HTML tags that should be assigned to a part in the
wireframe?

Main heading should be in the middle of the page right underneath the navigation. The navigation is another element that needs to be added where the labels: home, news, updates, and more are. The logo is in the upper left hand corner where "App Academy" is. There is also a button where it says "sign in." The subheading is the words "the lore", "the ipsum", "more info iterative", and "recursive." The main image tag is where it says "img" with the x marked across it. P tags would be all the text undernath the h2 tags. Link tags could be the navigation links as well as at the bottom in the footer ie. "FAQs and Private Policy" for example. Lists tags would be in the box where the text is blue and also could be the navigation links depending on how you want to do it. Social media icons would be the f and t right above the image tag to the right. The text share would be a button. In the footer, "App Academy" would be an image tag as well as the other one in the header.
